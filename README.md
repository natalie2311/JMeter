# JMeter
The goal of the project was to create two types of tests - a load test and a performance test - using JMeter. The load test had a maximum load of 200 users and a duration of 2 minutes, while the performance test had a maximum load of 50 users and a duration of 7 minutes.

Both tests were conducted using JMeterl, and a report was generated for each test. The reports included metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rate to provide insight into the performance and scalability of the system.
